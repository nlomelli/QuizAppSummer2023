This is my first github  using Android Studio learning mobile app with Java

On this app the key is the firebase realtime database access, I had to read a lot about JSON files and firebase to read and write elements in the database from the Android app.

I follow different guides and tried different commands but most of the failed.

I have to finish the scores reading and saving.
